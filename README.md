## Description

This is a template repository for a FastAPI back-end project. It is intended to be used as a starting 
point for a new project. It has OAuth2 authentication and JWT token generation. It also has a basic 
user model and CRUD operations for users.

## Overview

Kidney stones can be painful and dangerous if not detected early. This project aims to make the detection 
process faster and more accurate by using the power of artificial intelligence. In this project focus to 
using advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze ultrasound images 
of the kidneys and identify any potential stones. It's a smart way of using computer technology to spot 
kidney stones in pictures of the kidneys, helping doctors identify and treat them faster and more accurately.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can accurately detect the presence 
of kidney stones in ultrasound medical images.
